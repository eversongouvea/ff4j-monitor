```

## Using the example
When running the example you can access it by going to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

There is a REST endpoint [/message](http://localhost:8080/message) that will return a simple message property from application.properties. It will add a new feature flag called "Friends". If you enable turn on that feature flag with the web console and then hit the [/message](http://localhost:8080/message) endpoint again it will display a different message.
